# Algorithms on Python 

* merge => inversions count
* mincut_graph => calculate minimum cut for graph
* dijkstra => dijkstra, heap based
* median_maintenance => maintains median for incoming numbers without sorting but by using two heaps
* 2sum => compute the number of target values t in the interval [-10000,10000] (inclusive) such that there are distinct numbers x,y in the input file that satisfy x+y=t
* strong_comp.py => computing sizes of strongly connected components in graph
